# Diamond vs Hexagons - OpenGL Game

Welcome to the Diamond vs Hexagons game, a twist on the classic Plants vs Zombies implemented using OpenGL! In this game, diamonds defend against hexagones using stars as projectiles. The game features three squares representing lives, collision detection between hexagons, diamonds, and projectiles, as well as various interactive functionalities.

## Features

### 1. Game Elements
- Diamonds and hexagons: Representing defenders and attackers, respectively.
- Stars: Projectiles launched by diamonds to fend off hexagons. **(Note: Stars only shoot when a hexagon of the same color spawns on the line.)**
- Squares: Displaying the remaining lives of the player.

### 2. Drag and Drop Functionality
- **Diamond Placement:** Drag diamonds to desired squares to strategically position them for defense.
- **Cost System:** Dragging a diamond incurs a point cost, adding a strategic layer to placement decisions.

### 3. Points and Randomized Stars
- **Point System:** Dragging diamonds costs points; earn points by shooting hexagons with stars.
- **Randomized Stars:** Stars spawn randomly, adding unpredictability to the game.

### 4. Right-Click Despawn
- **Despawn Diamonds:** Right-clicking on a diamond removes it from the game, providing flexibility in defense strategy.

### 5. Animation
- **Rotation, Translation, and Scaling:** Enjoy smooth animations as diamonds undergo dynamic transformations for a visually engaging experience.

### Note: Despite downloading the source code, the game may not be fully playable due to additional dependencies or setup requirements beyond simple compilation and execution.
